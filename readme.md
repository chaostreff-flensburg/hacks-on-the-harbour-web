<!-- ## Development

Pushing to master is restricted. Please work in a `feature/` or `bug/` branch and create a pull request. Merging requires the CI passing, an approved review and the branch being up to date. -->

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production
$ npm run build
```

## Deploy a new version

To deploy a new version of the site push your changes to the ```deploy``` branch via a pull request. The ```deploy-ghpages``` GitHub Action will then build and release on GH-Pages.

## Frameworks

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Vuepress docs](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
