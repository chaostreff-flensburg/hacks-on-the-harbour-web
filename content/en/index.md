# Welcome to the first "Hacks on the Harbour"!

Hacks on the Harbour is a maker & hacker festival - right next to Sønderborg harbour. We pair a great view with a diverse schedule. Expect several workshops, inspiring talks and a lot of space to connect with new people!

We start in 2022 with a one-day festival on June 25 (Saturday), from 12:00 p.m. (noon) till 10:00 p.m. It will be organized by the German non-profit organization ["Chaostreff Flensburg e.V."](https://chaostreff-flensburg.de/) in cooperation with the generous support of the [Biblioteket Sønderborg](https://biblioteket.sonderborg.dk/). 
Please help us with planning room sizes, chairs, and of course the amount of pizza we have to order, by registering for a free ticket today!

The whole conference will be held in English. 

We provide a shuttle service from Flensburg, more information [here](#shuttle-from-flensburg).

[You can get your free ticket here.](https://tickets.chaostreff-flensburg.de/ctfl/hoth2022/)

This event is a follow-up to our popular event ["Hacks on the Beach"](https://chaostreff-flensburg.de/2021/hacks-on-the-beach-2022/) in Flensburg. It will be similar to our ["Rüspeler Tüfteltage"](https://www.ruetueta.de/), an event we co-organize at the "Kliemannsland" in Lower Saxony.

## FAQ

### Is there an age limit?

There is no "age limit", but some rules do apply: If you are at least 18 years old, or accompanied by an adult, there is no limitation.
If you are between 12 and 18 years old, we recommend you stay for the workshops and leave the event after the pizza party. If you are from Flensburg, we will provide accompanied travel if you hold a "Neue Tüftler" ticket.

### Where is the event located?
Biblioteket Sønderborg (Nørre Havnegade 15, 6400 Sønderborg, Dänemark)

### Can I just come for meeting people and/or work on my own project?
Absolutely yes! Our events live in the spirit of DIY, hacking and working on projects you have limited time for at home. Another important part of our events is meeting people and creating new friendships. The workshops and talks are a nice optional bonus for some visitors. Coming from our past events, a lot of the experience is making time to work on your own project or finding others and work together. We will have workspaces for that. If you want to bring more than your laptop and 5V electronics, please ask us before. Send us an email to hoth@chaostreff-flensburg.de!

### Why is it just on a Saturday?
Normally our events take place on a full weekend, from Friday to Sunday. Because it is our first event at a new location and there is still a pandemic situation, we are planning a small event. If everything works out, look forward to a full weekend in 2023.

### How much for a ticket?
The tickets are free, but you can contribute to the event and pay an amount of your choosing. The money is managed by the German non-profit Chaostreff Flensburg e.V. and is only made possible because of the generous accommodation by the Biblioteket Sønderborg!
