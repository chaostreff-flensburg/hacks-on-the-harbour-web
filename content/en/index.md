It takes about 40 minutes to get from Flensburg to S√∏nderborg. From Hamburg you should plan at least 2 hours and 15 minutes for the journey. From Apenrade it takes 30 minutes and from Kolding about 60 minutes. Use the navigation system of your choice.
There is a multi-storey car park next to the library (charges apply). There are also charging stations for electric cars. There are other parking spaces in the vicinity, some of which are free of charge.

Looking for a ride? We have created a [networking ride share pad](https://md.ctfl.space/mfg).

#### üöÇ Train
It is only a 12-minute walk from S√∏nderborg train station to the Biblioteket S√∏nderborg, but it takes you about 2 hours and 30 minutes by train from Flensburg. For this reason, we do not recommend it. From Kolding it takes about 1 hour and 19 minutes.

#### üöå Shuttle from Flensburg
Due to low demand there will be no shuttle bus from Flensburg this year. We recommend travelling by public transport. From Flensburg there is the bus line 110.

You can take bus line 110 (operated by Sydtrafik) from Flensburg to the station "Arnkilgade v sygehuset" and then walk for 15 minutes. It will take you a total of 1:20 hours. The price is about 6‚Ç¨. You can find more information on the website: [sydatrafik.dk](https://www.sydtrafik.dk/).
If the price is a problem for you, write an email to hoth@chaostreff-flensburg.de and we will find a solution. For example: reimbursement of bus travel costs.

If you really want to travel by boat, there is a ferry connection from Langballigau to S√∏nderborg.

### Can I come by to just meet new people or work on my own project?
Absolutely! That's exactly what our events are all about: hacking, tinkering and working on your own projects that you don't have time for at home and gaining new inspiration in the process. Another point is to make new connections and acquaintances. We have extra locations on site for this, which have often been used at our previous events. If you want to bring something bigger than just your laptop and Arduino (etc.), please write us a short email beforehand: hoth@chaostreff-flensburg.de

### How much does a ticket cost?
The tickets are free, but you can contribute a voluntary amount to the event. The money will be administered by the Chaostreff Flensburg e.V. (non-profit).

### Drinks
There is tap water and coffee in the library. We will also bring a electric kettle, but it is better if you bring your own tea. We will also bring Mate, Fritz Cola and some Fritz lemonades and provide them for a donation (preferably in Euros). However, we can only bring a limited amount. So feel free to bring your own drinks or see what is available in the local shops. The selection will be different from other countries.

There will be no official bar. Again, you are invited to bring your own drinks and share with others.

### Telephony (DECT)
Eventphone will offer their usual DECT phone network that you might know from other Chaos events.
You can simply bring a [DECT handset](https://eventphone.de/doku/dect_phone_compatibility_list) and register an extension for yourself in [Eventphone's registration utility](https://guru3.eventphone.de/). The network will also support telephony via SIP (e.g. on your mobile phone or for anyone staying at home).

### On-site hygiene
In Denmark, there are currently no hygiene restrictions because of Covidien. In general, the issue has been treated less strongly there than in Germany. We still ask that you do not come with an infectious disease. We will provide masks and Covid tests free of charge. There is no mask requirement on site. Please respect if others wear a mask.

### Photo Policy
Not allowed are "unsolicited recordings or portraits (picture, video, sound) of other persons". However, as with [our last events](https://www.flickr.com/photos/157585171@N05/), we want to have pictures as documentation of the event. Therefore, [kekskurse](https://gallery.kekskurse.de/) will again be active as photographer. To make it easy to see who agrees to the publication of the pictures taken, we will have different coloured key rings for the name tags on site. Purple or yellow means you do **not** want your pictures to be published. Green or black means you agree. If you have any questions about this, write us an email or talk to us on site.

### Quiet Room 
There are two quiet rooms during the day. You can use them when you need a quiet break. The rooms are equipped with tables and chairs. Please be as quiet as possible and talk elsewhere if necessary. There is one room with wooden beams and a view of the water with the room number MP 1.1.
The second room is room M3.2, it is slightly smaller and does not have a direct window to the outside. 
If you need help finding the room, you can always contact the Orga and the library staff. Both rooms are signposted.
