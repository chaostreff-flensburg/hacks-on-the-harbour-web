### Arrival

#### üöó Car
It takes about 40 minutes to get from Flensburg to S√∏nderborg. From Hamburg you should plan at least 2 hours and 15 minutes for the journey. From Apenrade it takes 30 minutes and from Kolding about 60 minutes. Use the navigation system of your choice.
There is a multi-storey car park next to the library (charges apply). There are also charging stations for electric cars. There are other parking spaces in the vicinity, some of which are free of charge.

#### üöÇ Train
It is only a 12-minute walk from S√∏nderborg train station to the Biblioteket S√∏nderborg, but it takes you about 2 hours and 30 minutes by train from Flensburg. For this reason, we do not recommend it. From Kolding it takes about 1 hour and 19 minutes.

#### üöå Shuttle from Flensburg
Due to low demand there will be no shuttle bus from Flensburg this year. We recommend travelling by public transport. From Flensburg there is the bus line 110.

####  üõ•Ô∏è Bus
You can take bus line 110 (operated by Sydtrafik) from Flensburg to the station "Arnkilgade v sygehuset" and then walk for 15 minutes. It will take you a total of 1:20 hours. The price is about 6‚Ç¨. You can find more information on the website: [sydatrafik.dk](https://www.sydtrafik.dk/).
If the price is a problem for you, write an email to hoth@chaostreff-flensburg.de and we will find a solution. For example: reimbursement of bus travel costs.

#### Bicycle and boat
There is no direct ferry connection to S√∏nderborg.
If you really want to travel by boat, there is a ferry connection from Langballigau to S√∏nderborg.
If you have your own boat, you can moor directly at the harbour. 
From Flensburg it is 40 km by bike. 
In Langballigau there is also a bicycle ferry to the Danish side of the fjord.

### Can I come by to just meet new people or work on my own project?
Absolutely! That's exactly what our events are all about: hacking, tinkering and working on your own projects that you don't have time for at home and gaining new inspiration in the process. Another point is to make new connections and acquaintances. We have extra locations on site for this, which have often been used at our previous events. If you want to bring something bigger than just your laptop and Arduino (etc.), please write us a short email beforehand: hoth@chaostreff-flensburg.de

### How much does a ticket cost?
The tickets are free, but you can contribute a voluntary amount to the event. The money will be administered by the Chaostreff Flensburg e.V. (non-profit).
