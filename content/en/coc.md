# Code of Conduct - Chaostreff Flensburg e.V. Events

## English Version

### Why this Code of Conduct?
* Because we want our events to be a place where people can feel comfortable and where there is no discrimination or harassment. People who may have had bad experiences at events should see that we take discrimination and harassment seriously and do not tolerate it. 
* If people experience discrimination and harassment, they should know where they can turn to and feel comfortable to do so because they know they will be taken seriously. 
* Discrimination and harassment does not occur very often at our events. But as part of society as a whole, we have learned and developed behaviours that violate boundaries and that we may not have classified as such until now (e.g. closeness - distance, touching, terminology). We would like to sensitise attendees to this.

### Long version

The Chaos Computer Club is "according to its statutes and its membersâ€™ intentions, is a galactic community for all life forms. Consequently, we want to offer all participants at our events a safe and enjoyable experience, regardless of age, gender and sexual identity, physical or psychological circumstances, ethnic, regional and/or religious affiliation or origin, external appearance or socio-economic status." as stated in the [principles](https://help.ccc.de/principles.en.html).

Even if this goal cannot be achieved in its entirety due to social power relations, we would like to do our part. That is why we are formulating more explicitly for our events what is not wanted here.

#### Unwanted behaviour

At our events, we understand harassment to include:

* discriminatory statements, for example in relation to gender and sexual identity, physical and mental conditions, illness or appearance, age, ethnic, regional and/or religious / ideological affiliation or origin or socio-economic position.
* Unsolicited recordings or portraits (picture, video, sound) of other people
* Unwanted physical contact
* Unwanted sexualised attention (compliments, innuendos, looks, gestures, statements, actions)
* Sexualised depictions
* Insults, intimidation, stalking or threats of violence
* Unsolicited explanation or commentary on the actions of others
* deliberate use of incorrect pronouns (misgendering) and names or use of discarded names (deadnaming)
* Initiating relationships or sexual contact by taking advantage of hardship or structural inequalities (age, social position, etc.)
* Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviours.

#### Harassment does not include:
* Pointing out discriminatory, harassing or assaultive behaviour.
* Stating and setting boundaries (e.g. "Leave me alone" or "I don't want to discuss this with you").
* Actions that are done with the explicit consent of all parties involved.

This consent or agreement principle is based on the fact that only a YES is to be understood as a YES. If you do not have a yes for an action, it is to be refrained from. Statements that are not an explicit yes are to be understood as a no.

### Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies to our events and connected digital communites, but is not limited to actions and statements made at the events.

We believe that people should strive to be free from discrimination and harassment at all times and in all places.

Children and young people are as important a part of our community as any other participants. They are welcome at our Events and enjoy our special support and specific protection. This includes - not only, but of course also - the legal rules of Protection of Young Persons Act
