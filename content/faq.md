**Is there an age limit?**

Gernally speaking no. If you are over 18 years old or are accompanied by someone over 18 years old there is no limitation, through the best experience is probably 12years or older. If you are between 12 and 18 years old we definilty recommend you stay for the workshops and leave after the pizza party. From Flensburg we will provide accompanied travel if you have "Neue Tüftler" Ticket.

**Can I come just for meeting people and working on my own project?**
Yes definilty! The workshops and talks are an optinal bonus. A lot of the experience from our last events is time to work on your own project or to find others and work together. We will have workspaces for that. If you want to bring more than your laptop and 5V electronics please ask before. Write as an email to hoth@chaostreff-flensburg.de

**Why is it just on a saturday?**
Normally our events are full weekend from friday to sunday. Because it is our first event and their is still a pandamic situation we are planing a small event. If everything works out we will look for full weekend in 2023.

**How much is a ticket?**
The tickets are free but you can contribute to the event and pay an amount of your choosing. The money is managed by the german non-profit Chaostreff Flensburg e.V.. This is only possible because of the generous accomedation by the Biblioteket Sønderborg!
